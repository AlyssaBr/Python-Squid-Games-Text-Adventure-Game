# Introduction

Game Master △ ▢ ◯ :

Welcome Player 259.

Even though you hold a business degree, poor financial decisions have had a clear impact.

Now, you are in debt, on the edge of financial ruin.

We found you at a casino in Las Vegas, and gave you our business card, for a way to win quick money.

You took it, called us and we kindly picked you up and brought you here.

Even though it is too late for you now, here is some information about our game:

In order to succeed and win the price fund, you need to survive each of the three physically challenging games.

In the end, you will also need to answer a question to win the price fund.

If you do not pass each of the three games and final question, you will be...

...eliminated.

# Creator Notes:

Thank you, player 259 for choosing to play this game. Here is some guidance:

The difficulty level is high.

Each game will ask you to input specific things;

Such as letters, numbers, or words (such as shapes, names, direction, etc.).

If you do this incorrectly, you may be eliminated. Be aware.

There are fast ways to succeed in this game, but these are hard to find.

Many choices lead to different paths or bring you back to a path you could have been on if you would have chosen differently before. Be aware.

If you choose one wrong answer, you will automatically be eliminated and redirected to the start of the game. The only time you get to do a do-over is in the 'first' physical game. That is it.

And with that, let the game begin.
