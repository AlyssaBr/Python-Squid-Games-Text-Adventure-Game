    "Thank you, player 259 for choosing to play this game. Here is some guidance: \n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty level is high. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each game will ask you to input specific things; \n",
    "\n",
    "Such as letters, numbers, or words (such as shapes, names, direction, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do this incorrectly, you may be eliminated. Be aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are fast ways to succeed in this game, but these are hard to find. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many choices lead to different paths or bring you back to a path you could have been on if you would have chosen differently before. Be aware. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose one wrong answer, you will automatically be eliminated and redirected to the start of the game.\n",
    "The only time you get to do a do-over is in the 'first' physical game. That is it. \n",
    "\n",
    "And with that, let the game begin. \n",
